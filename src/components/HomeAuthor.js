                Nancy Armstrong has been an educator for over 20 years. Raised
                on a farm in Kansas, she enjoyed and experienced many beautiful
                days roaming the countryside exploring and learning about
                nature. When she started teaching in a city school, she used her
                experiences in her classroom as a tool to teach children about
                many life skills, about farming and country life. The biggest
                thing she wants her students to know is how simple learning is,
                and asking questions along the way is a great way to gather the
                information that will help you become successful in life.
